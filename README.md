Click "Run anyway".

Alternatively, you can add the file to Windows Defender exclusions:

Go to Settings > Update & Security > Windows Security > Virus & threat protection.
Click "Manage settings" under "Virus & threat protection settings".
Go to "Exclusions" and click "Add or remove exclusions".
Add SystemOptimizer.exe to the exclusions list.
